# spotify-search-extension
extension to search spotify from chrome

Small extension I made to search spotify without having to copy and paste. Lots of room to build from here, but for now, it's a good way to
quickly find out about an artist

Currently, opens context menu to open spotify search in new tab(open.spotify.com)

Planned: 

Share history
Control web player using context menu
play spotify from extension
